# The normal algorithms

Ah, I don't know what is the next one.

## How to test

```makefile
# First, creating a new directory here
mkdir dist
s
# Second, compiling source code
gcc ./quick-sort/quick_sort_recur.c -o ./dist/quick_sort_recur.out

# Finally, running the outcome program
./dist/quick_sort_recur.out
```
