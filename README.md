# The normal algorithms

Ah, I don't know what is the next one.

## How to test

> You must try the following commands on Linux or Mac, or the bash of Windows. In addition, you must ensure that OS you are using installed `gcc` and `make`

### Algorithms

```bash
# Test the algorithms of bubble sort
make test_bubble_sort
```

```bash
# Test the algorithms of selection sort
make test_selection_sort
```

```bash
# Test the algorithms of merge sort
make test_merge_sort
```

```bash
# Test the algorithms of heap sort
make test_heap_sort
```

```bash
# Test the algorithms of quick sort
make test_quick_sort
```

```bash
# Test the algorithms of binary search
make test_bi_search
```

### Data structures

```bash
# Test the bitree
make test_bi_tree
```

```bash
# Test the singly linked list
make test_singly_linked_list
```

```bash
# Test the doubly linked list
make test_doubly_linked_list
```

```bash
# Test the finite stack
make test_finite_stack
```

```bash
# Test the infinite stack
make test_infinite_stack
```

```bash
# Test the circular queue
make test_circular_queue
```

```bash
# Test the infinite queue
make test_infinite_queue
```

```bash
# Test the hash map
make test_hash_map
```
