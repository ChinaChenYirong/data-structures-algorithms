# The normal algorithms

Ah, I don't know what is the next one.

## How to test

> You must try the following commands on Linux or Mac, or the bash of Windows. In addition, you must ensure that OS you are using installed `gcc` and `make`

```bash
# Test the algorithms of quick-sort
make test_quick_sort_recur
```

```bash
# Test the bitree
make test_bi_tree
```

```bash
# Test the singly linked list
make test_singly_linked_list
```

```bash
# Test the doubly linked list
make test_doubly_linked_list
```

```bash
# Test the finite stack
make test_finite_stack
```
